# AU Logistics Warehouse Quote System

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: This is the main documentation entry point. Always start here.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

A professional warehouse quote management system built with FastAPI and React.

## Knowledge Graph System

The project includes a sophisticated knowledge graph system for code analysis and maintenance. This system helps track code relationships, detect potential issues, and maintain code quality.

### Components

#### 1. Graph Database (`tools/db/graph_db.py`)
- SQLite-based graph database for storing code structure
- Supports incremental updates and structure queries
- Maintains relationships between code components
- Provides dead code and duplicate detection

#### 2. TypeScript Analyzer (`tools/kg/ts_analyzer.py`)
- Parses TypeScript/TSX files
- Extracts classes, methods, functions, and relationships
- Integrates with the knowledge graph system
- Handles imports and dependencies

#### 3. Graph Updater (`tools/kg/graph_updater.py`)
- Watches for file changes in Python and TypeScript files
- Implements smart validation to prevent unnecessary updates
- Supports four types of updates:
  - `SYNTAX_ONLY`: Only whitespace or comments changed (skipped)
  - `MINOR`: Small changes that don't affect structure
  - `STRUCTURAL`: Changes that affect code structure
  - `BREAKING`: Changes that could break dependencies
- Uses file hashing to detect real changes
- Batches updates for better performance

#### 4. Visualization Dashboard (`tools/visualization/dashboard.py`)
- Interactive Streamlit-based dashboard
- Real-time graph visualization
- Dead code analysis
- Code duplication detection
- Statistics and metrics

### Update Validation System

The knowledge graph implements a robust validation system to ensure updates are appropriate:

1. **Change Detection**
   - File hashing to detect actual content changes
   - Skips updates if only whitespace or comments changed
   - Validates syntax before processing

2. **Structure Analysis**
   - Compares old and new code structure
   - Tracks changes in classes, methods, functions, and imports
   - Identifies breaking changes that could affect dependencies

3. **Update Classification**
   - SYNTAX_ONLY: Skipped (comments, whitespace)
   - MINOR: Method body changes, non-structural updates
   - STRUCTURAL: New classes/functions added
   - BREAKING: Removed or renamed components

4. **Safety Measures**
   - Transaction-based updates
   - Rollback on errors
   - Detailed logging of all changes
   - Batched processing to prevent overwrites

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install -g typescript @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/typescript-estree
```

2. Start the knowledge graph system:
```bash
python tools/start_knowledge_graph.py
```

This will:
- Launch the visualization dashboard
- Start the file watcher
- Begin tracking code changes

### Usage

The system automatically:
- Tracks changes in Python and TypeScript files
- Updates the knowledge graph when appropriate
- Provides real-time visualization
- Alerts on potential issues (dead code, duplicates)

### Configuration

Key configuration files:
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Areas for Streamlining and Improvement

Based on a recent architecture review, the following areas have been identified for streamlining and improvement:

- **Rate System - Missing Basic CRUD Operations:** Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for rates to complete the rate management system.
- **OAuth Integration (Planned):** Implement OAuth to enhance security and user experience.
- **Caching:** Actively utilize Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement a robust monitoring and alerting system (e.g., Sentry, Prometheus Alertmanager, Prometheus, Grafana).
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Adopt IaC practices using Terraform or similar tools.
- **CI/CD:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar tools.
- **Shared Services:** Ensure that shared components are well-maintained and documented.
- **API Architecture:** Ensure that OpenAPI specification, versioned endpoints, rate limiting, and caching headers are fully implemented and documented.

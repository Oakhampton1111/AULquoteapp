# Docker Bake Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing Docker Bake in the AUL Quote App project to streamline our Docker build and deployment process.

## Why Docker Bake?
Docker Bake will provide several key benefits for our project:
- Simplified build commands with `docker buildx bake`
- Standardized build configurations across environments
- Parallel building of frontend and backend components
- Better caching and context deduplication
- Environment-specific customization
- Multi-architecture support

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Setup
1. Create base Dockerfiles:
   ```dockerfile
   # frontend/Dockerfile
   # Backend/Dockerfile
   ```

2. Implement basic docker-bake.hcl:
   ```hcl
   group "default" {
     targets = ["frontend", "backend"]
   }

   target "frontend" {
     context = "./frontend"
     dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
     tags = ["aul-quote-app/frontend:${VERSION}"]
   }

   target "backend" {
     context = "./warehouse_quote_app"
     dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
     tags = ["aul-quote-app/backend:${VERSION}"]
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Environment Configuration
1. Development and Production Targets:
   ```hcl
   # Development targets
   target "frontend-dev" {
     inherits = ["frontend"]
     target = "development"
   }

   target "backend-dev" {
     inherits = ["backend"]
     target = "development"
   }

   # Production targets
   target "frontend-prod" {
     inherits = ["frontend"]
     target = "production"
     args = {
       NODE_ENV = "production"
     }
   }

   target "backend-prod" {
     inherits = ["backend"]
     target = "production"
     args = {
       PYTHON_ENV = "production"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Matrix Builds Configuration:
   ```hcl
   target "multi-platform" {
     platforms = [
       "linux/amd64",
       "linux/arm64"
     ]
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: CI/CD Integration
1. GitHub Actions Integration:
   ```yaml
   build:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Build images
         run: docker buildx bake --file docker-bake.hcl
   ```

2. Build Cache Configuration:
   ```hcl
   # Enable build cache
   target "common" {
     cache-from = ["type=registry,ref=myregistry.azurecr.io/cache"]
     cache-to = ["type=registry,ref=myregistry.azurecr.io/cache"]
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Optimization
1. Shared Base Images:
   ```hcl
   target "base" {
     dockerfile = "Dockerfile.base"
     tags = ["aul-quote-app/base:${VERSION}"]
   }
   ```

2. Cache Optimization:
   - Implement layer caching strategies
   - Configure buildkit cache settings
   - Set up registry caching

## Usage Examples

### Local Development
```bash
# Build all services
docker buildx bake

# Build specific target
docker buildx bake frontend-dev

# Build production images
docker buildx bake --set *.args.VERSION=1.0.0 frontend-prod backend-prod
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# Build and push all production images
docker buildx bake --push production

# Build multi-platform images
docker buildx bake --set *.platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 production
```

## Benefits

1. **Development Benefits**
   - Consistent builds across team members
   - Simplified local development setup
   - Easy environment switching

2. **Operations Benefits**
   - Standardized production builds
   - Efficient caching and layer reuse
   - Multi-architecture support
   - Reduced build times

3. **Maintenance Benefits**
   - Single source of truth for build configurations
   - Version-controlled build settings
   - Easy updates and modifications

## Next Steps

1. Complete Knowledge Graph update
2. Review current Dockerfile configurations
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Test builds in development environment
5. Proceed with remaining phases

## Notes

- Keep existing Docker Compose setup for local development until Bake implementation is complete
- Test thoroughly in development before deploying to production
- Document any issues or improvements during implementation

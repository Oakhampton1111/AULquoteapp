## Notes

- Focus on maintaining high-quality output
- Regular test suite updates with new examples
- Continuous monitoring of quality metrics
- Documentation of test results and insights
- Regular refinement of test criteria
- Previously provided edge cases and "good quote output" examples were used in earlier test suites. If these were lost during test suite deletion, the USER can provide them again to ensure comprehensive coverage of:
  - Complex vehicle configurations
  - Special coverage requirements
  - Unusual term lengths
  - Multi-vehicle quotes
  - Custom coverage combinations
  - High-value vehicle scenarios
  - Modified vehicle cases
  - Commercial use cases
  - These examples serve as our "gold standard" for quote output quality and format

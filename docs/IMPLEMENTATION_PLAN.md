# Rate Calculator Implementation Plan

## A. Rate Calculator Updates [Completed]

### Core Implementation
- [x] Create RateCalculator class in `app/services/business/rate_calculator.py`
- [x] Implement mandatory charge enforcement
- [x] Add service exclusion logic
- [x] Build quantity break handler
- [x] Develop surcharge calculation system

## B. Business Rule Engine [Completed]

### Rule Engine Core
- [x] Create BusinessRuleEngine in `app/services/business/rule_engine.py`
- [x] Implement service combination validator
- [x] Add DG surcharge enforcement
- [x] Create free period manager
- [x] Build special case handler

## C. Integration Points [Completed]

### Quote Service Updates
- [x] Update QuoteService to use new RateCalculator
- [x] Integrate business rule application
- [x] Add mandatory charge handling

## D. LLM Integration [Completed]

### Conversational Updates
- [x] Create natural language prompt templates
- [x] Implement context-aware question generation
- [x] Add missing information detection
- [x] Build conversational state management

### Example Conversation Flow:
```
Customer: "I need a quote for storing some machinery."

LLM: "I'd be happy to help you with a storage quote for your machinery. 
To provide you with the most accurate quote, I'll need to understand a few things:
- What are the dimensions of your machinery?
- How long do you need to store it?
- Is it rackable (can it be stored on standard pallet racking)?
- Does it contain any dangerous goods?"

[System processes responses through RateCalculator]

Customer: "It's 3 meters long, 2 meters wide, and non-rackable."

LLM: "Thank you for those details. To finalize your quote, I just need a few more pieces of information:
- What is the height of the machinery?
- How long do you anticipate needing storage?
- Will you need any transport services to get it to our facility?"

[Continues natural conversation while gathering required data]
```

### Implementation Notes:
1. Focus on natural conversation flow 
2. Avoid rigid form-like interactions 
3. Allow for context-carrying between messages 
4. Enable follow-up questions based on partial information 
5. Support clarification requests in natural language 

## E. Container Calculator Implementation [Completed]

### Container Calculator
- [x] Implement container calculator
- [x] Add support for container transport

## Timeline

### Week 1-2 (Completed)
- Core infrastructure setup
- Storage service implementation
- Basic rate calculations

### Week 3-4 (Completed)
- Transport service implementation
- Distance calculation integration
- Zone management system

### Week 5 (Completed)
- Container service implementation
- Personal effects handling
- Material calculations

### Week 6-7 (Current)
- Testing implementation
- Documentation updates
- UI/UX improvements

### Week 8

## Notes
- All core calculators are now implemented
- Focus shifting to testing and documentation
- UI/UX improvements to be prioritized based on user feedback
- Performance optimization will be addressed after core functionality is stable

## Dependencies
- Rate data must be kept up to date
- Postcode database requires regular updates
- Documentation must be maintained as features are added
- Testing coverage should be maintained at >80%

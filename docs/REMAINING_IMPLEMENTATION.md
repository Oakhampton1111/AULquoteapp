## Implementation Priority Order

1. ~~Transport Rate Calculator~~ [COMPLETED]
   - ~~Critical for accurate quote generation~~
   - ~~Required for combined service quotes~~
   - ~~Added postcode-based distance calculation~~

2. Container Service Calculator [NEXT]
   - Needed for complete service offering
   - Dependencies on transport rates

3. Unit Standardization System
   - Supports both transport and container calculations
   - Ensures consistent measurements

4. Integration Components
   - Connects all components
   - Provides user interface

## Timeline Estimate

- ~~Transport Rate Calculator: 3 days~~ [COMPLETED]
- Container Service Calculator: 2 days [NEXT]
- Unit Standardization System: 2 days
- Integration Components: 3 days

Total Estimated Time: 7 working days remaining

## Testing Requirements

Each component requires:
- Unit tests for calculations
- Integration tests for service combinations
- End-to-end tests for complete quotes
- Performance testing for rate lookups
